## Build instructions

### Install dependencies

Install [golang](https://golang.org/dl/) and configure go. Git clone this repo in `~/gocode/src/github.com/kushaldas/unoon`.

Install go dependences:

In fedora: `sudo dnf install libpcap-devel redis`

Start redis service:

```sh
sudo systemctl start redis
```

Install python dependencies:

In Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-qt5 python3-redis python3-yaml python3-psutil audit`

### Build

Build the go portion with:

```sh
go build github.com/kushaldas/unoon/cmd/unoon
```

### Setting up audit rules

Put the following in the `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file.

```
## First rule - delete all
-D

## Increase the buffers to survive stress events.
## Make this bigger for busy systems
-b 8192

## This determine how long to wait in burst of events
--backlog_wait_time 0

## Set failure mode to syslog
-f 1

-a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S connect,listen,bind -k unoon_network
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S exit,exit_group -k unoon_exit
```

Remember as this tool is in the development stage, we will keep changing and adding a lot more rules in the coming days.

In future we may add rules in a different way, but for now, we will use `auditd` itself.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start auditd
$ sudo systemctl status auditd
$ sudo systemctl stop auditd
$ sudo auditctl -l
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S connect,bind,listen -F key=unoon_network
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S exit,exit_group -F key=unoon_exit

```

On Fedora you may have to use the `service` command.

```bash
$ sudo service auditd restart
$ sudo service auditd stop
```


The last command should show you output as shown above.

### Redis server configuration

You should run the redis server along with a password for production, and you
can provide the same using the following format in `/etc/unoon/unoon.yml`
file.

If the file does not exist, it will assume no password is required.

```yaml
---
server: "localhost:6379"
password: "yourpassword"
db:     0
```

### Start

Start the backend:

```sh
sudo ./unoon
```

You can pass a different interface name with `-device` flag to the `unoon` executable.

Next, create the database directory and also the sqlite database.

```sh
sudo mkdir /var/lib/unoon
sudo python3 ./desktop/udesktop/db.py
```

Start the frontend:

```sh
sudo python3 ./desktop/udesktop/main.py
```
